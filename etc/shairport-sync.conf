//		The default is "Hostname" -- i.e. the machine's hostname with the first letter capitalised (ASCII only.)
//		You can use the following substitutions:
//				%h for the hostname,
//				%H for the Hostname (i.e. with first letter capitalised (ASCII only)),
//				%v for the version number, e.g. 3.0 and
//				%V for the full version string, e.g. 3.0-OpenSSL-Avahi-ALSA-soxr-metadata-sysconfdir:/etc
//		Overall length can not exceed 50 characters. Example: "Shairport Sync %v on %H".
//	password = "secret"; // leave this commented out if you don't want to require a password
